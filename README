University project - keylogger as Linux kernel module.


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

Client side:

Go to /client directory and run below commands.
$ make
$ ./install.sh
$ make clean (optional)

Server side:

Go to /server directory and run below command.
$ python server.py

Client ID in config.ini is the first free id  which can be assign to client. Before first
start of the server make sure that it is set to 0.


Requirements
------------

Requires Python 3.x version.


Tests
-----

Unfortunately client  side (keylogger) is  not testable. Server side tests are located in
/server/tests/ directory.

parser_test.py - checks whether logged keys are properly  transformed to readable format.

protocol_test.py - checks whether server properly responses for given set of requests and
                   messages
